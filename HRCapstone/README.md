# HR Analytics Capstone: Understanding Employee Attrition

This project explores the key drivers of employee attrition using a real-world HR dataset.

# Project Goal

Use data analytics to uncover key drivers of employee attrition and propose actionable HR strategies to improve employee retention.

# Key Insights
Overtime, low income, and early-career stage are strong indicators of attrition. 
16.1% of employees left the company. 
Employees with lower monthly income are more likely to leave. 
Attrition is most common among younger employees and those with under 3 years at the 
company. 
Sales and Research roles show higher risk of turnover. 
Younger employees and those with less tenure need targeted retention support.

# Recommendations
Introduce flexible work options to reduce burnout in overtime, heavy roles. 
Review compensation structures for fairness and market alignment. 
Invest in early career mentorship and engagement programs. 
Identify high risk roles and provide tailored retention strategies. 
Conduct stay interviews during the first year of employment to proactively address 
concerns.
